IP-Registry-0211.005, 2002.11.08
--------------------------------
If hostname ends in two-letter top-level domain, this is changed to 
upper case and returned, with no further processing (thx, Rob Knobben,
Rivals Digital Media).


IP-Registry-0211.004, 2002.11.08
--------------------------------
Tweak to Makefile.PL that should shorten installation time.
Documented the weird IP range problem.


IP-Registry-0211.003, 2002.11.08
--------------------------------
Performance boost. On my machine, was looking up one IP address every
17 seconds. Now looks up more than 256 IPs per second! Like the old
programming adage goes - "make it work, then make it fast".


IP-Registry-0211.002, 2002.11.07
--------------------------------
Now uses AnyDBM_File, which should be a bit more compatible.
A couple of typos have been fixed in the POD.
README added.


IP-Registry-0211.001, 2002.11.07
--------------------------------
First attempt at producing a combined interface to the internet address
registries. Seems to work.
